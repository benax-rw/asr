Like a small boat on the ocean, sending big waves into motion, like how a single bird can make a heart open.
I might only have one badge, but I can make an explosion.
And all those things I didn't say were wrecking balls inside my brain.
I was screaming out tonight, can you hear my voice?
This time, this is my fight song.
Take back my life song, prove that my life's song.
My power's turned lost on it right now.
I'll be strong, I'll fly my flight song.
And I don't really care if nobody else believes.
Because I've still got a lot of fight left in me.
I'm losing friends and I'm chasing sleep.
Everybody's worried about me and 2D.
I say I'm in 2D and 2D.
But it's been two years, I'm missing home.
There's fire burning in my balls, still believe.
Yeah, still believe.
None of those things I didn't say were wrecking balls inside my brain.
I was screaming out tonight, can you hear my voice?
This time, this is my fight song.
Take back my life song, prove that my life's song.
And my power's turned lost on it right now.
I'll be strong, I'll fly my flight song.
And I don't really care if nobody else believes.
Because I've still got a lot of fight left in me.
A lot of fight left in me.
Like a small boat on the ocean,
sending big waves into motion.
Like how a single word can make a heart open.
I might only have one match.
But I can make that explosion.
This is my fight song.
Take back my life song, prove that my life's song.
My power's turned lost on it right now.
I'll be strong, I'll fly my flight song.
And I don't really care if nobody else believes.
Because I've still got a lot of fight left in me.
No, I've still got a lot of fight left in me.
I'll be strong, I'll fly my flight song.
