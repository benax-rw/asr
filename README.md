# 🗣️ Hands-on with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

This repository contains code and resources for a hands-on session exploring **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** using state-of-the-art models like OpenAI Whisper and Faster-Whisper.

## 📌 What You'll Learn
- How ASR works: from audio input to transcribed text
- The role of preprocessing, tokenization, and decoding
- Running ASR models locally on audio files
- Understanding model files (e.g., tokenizer, config, model.bin)
- Introduction to Hugging Face and language-specific fine-tuning

## 📂 Contents
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01_audio_to_text_file.py` | Transcribes an audio file to a `.txt` file using Whisper or Faster-Whisper |
